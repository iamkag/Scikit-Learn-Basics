## Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide easy-to-understand examples of basic machine learning models and data processing techniques using Scikit-Learn. Each example is structured to help users understand the core concepts of machine learning, from loading datasets to evaluating model performance.

## Examples Included

The following examples are covered:

1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling.
2. **Classification** - Examples with models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
3. **Regression** - Basic regression models, including Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
4. **Clustering** - Introduction to clustering techniques like K-Means.
5. **Model Evaluation** - Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and cross-validation.
6. **Dimensionality Reduction** - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for feature reduction.
